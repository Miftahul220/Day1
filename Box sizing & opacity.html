    <p> If there was a day that india dominated world cricket, it was on thr fourth day of the match. Yes, India won the world Cup on 25 june 1983 and so that counted, too. But the day I'm talking about was when two Indian batsman made made eleven Australian cricketers dance to their tune. They did it in lublic and they did it the whole day.</p>

  <div class="div2">
    <p> Here is what happened. Laxman and Dravid continied to play and added 357 runs for the fifth wicket. Day 4 started at 274/4 and ended at 589/4. Nine of the eleven members of the Australian team took turn bowling, but none of them succeeded ib getting a wicket. The crowd at Eden Gardens became passessed. They chanted Laxman's name enough times to make steve waugh visibly grumpy. The team that had guven us a follow-on could not bowl one batsman out.</p>
