   <p> My own shadow  is a word, but hidden inside are thousands of unspoken words, stories of loneliness and the depths of soul-searching. There are times in life when everyone around my is busy, all sounds fall silent... then only my shadow is there. It doesn't say anything, yet it seems to understand; it doesn't give any assurance, yet it keeps my company</p>
